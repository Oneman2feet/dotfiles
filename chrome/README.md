Chrome Settings
===============

Chrome is pretty great, but there are a few things to add to it that make using it even more productive

# Omnibox Aliases

There is a cool hack using the chrome search engine features that lets you add shortcuts to the omnibox

1.  Go to ```chrome://settings```
2.  Click the "Manage search engines" button under **Search**
3.  In "Other search engines," add your own by giving it a name, keyword, and URL

For example, some useful ones I use are:

| Name | Keyword | URL |
| ---- | ------- | --- |
| Chai Notes | chai | https://trello.com/b/fyIyWFdf/chai-notes |
| Chrome Settings | settings | ```chrome://settings``` |
| Cornell People Search | people | https://www.cornell.edu/search/?tab=people |
